# Terminal-Backgammon-in-Java
A local 1v1 terminal backgammon game developed in Java. 

To run, first compile Gameboard (javac Gameboard.java), then compile Backgammon (javac Backgammon.java), then run it (java Backgammon).

Currently includes the game logic, will add a menu/score/tutorial (read rules from a file). Maybe add AI (later).
