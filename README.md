# Terminal-Backgammon-in-Java
A local 1v1 terminal backgammon game developed in Java. Includes use of ANSI colors to change the appearance of the terminal. OOP-oriented.

Future work: add a menu/score/tutorial system. Add an AI system.

To run: first compile Gameboard (javac Gameboard.java), then compile Backgammon (javac Backgammon.java), then run it (java Backgammon).

Developed during my first year at the Uni. of Warwick (2017).
